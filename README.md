# Tank Fleet Size Estimation: A Simulation Study

## Project Overview
This project investigates various statistical estimators to estimate the total number of tanks in an adversary's fleet. The study involves theoretical derivations and a simulation study to evaluate the performance of four estimators under different scenarios.

## Objectives
- Compare the performance of the **Minimum Variance Unbiased Estimator (MVUE)**, **Method of Moments (MoM)**, **Scaled Mean**, and **Total Range** estimators.
- Assess estimator bias, variance, and distribution characteristics using simulation data.
